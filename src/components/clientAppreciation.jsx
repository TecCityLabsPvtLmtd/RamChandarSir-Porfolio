      '"I have worked with BASCO systems for over 3 years now. And in last 3 years, i have been interacting with Ram for 2 years. Most striking aspect about Ram is his good listening skills. He patiently listens to my requirements, asks questions and gets me the exact talent search i require. There has been times, where i had to blow my cool off and Ram took it on a lighter vein and was a sport. His follow up pattern with candidates on offer to closure is fantastic. Wonder wat strategy he uses?? Though, i have asked him a couple of times, he responds with a smile "Trade Secrets!" ;)With excellent results, coupled with quality and time bound, Ram is a good mix of a Partner to help you close your requirements. Way to go Ram!!"',
